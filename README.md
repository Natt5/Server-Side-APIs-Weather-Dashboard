# Challenge 8 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that provides real-time weather updates for various cities. It utilises the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS for an interactive experience.

### Motivation

### Features

Search Functionality: Users can search for a city and view its current weather conditions and 5-day forecast.

Search History: Maintains a search history for quick access to previously 10 searched cities.

Persistent Data: Utilises 'localStorage' to store search history even after the browser is refreshed.

Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

### Technologies Used

HTML,CSS, JavaScript, OpenWeatherMap API, Bootstrap
